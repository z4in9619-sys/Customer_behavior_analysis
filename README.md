# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## 🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **data analytics workflow**, from data acquisition to visualization and presentation. It involves:

* Loading and exploring a dataset using Python
* Cleaning and transforming data for analysis
* Running SQL queries on a **MySQL** server for deeper insights
* Building an interactive **Power BI dashboard**
* Summarizing insights in a **project report** and **presentation (Gamma app)**

The goal is to extract meaningful business insights through data-driven analysis and visualization.

## 🔍 Steps in the Project

### 1. **Data Loading**

* Imported the dataset using Python (`pandas.read_csv()`).
* Inspected basic structure, data types, and missing values.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Performed statistical summaries and visual analyses.
* Used plots (histograms, heatmaps, boxplots, correlation matrix) to identify patterns and outliers.

### 3. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

* Handled missing, duplicate, and inconsistent data.
* Encoded categorical variables and normalized numeric features.
* Prepared final cleaned dataset for SQL and BI use.

### 4. **SQL Analysis (MySQL Server)**

* Imported cleaned data into MySQL.
* Wrote and executed SQL queries to answer key business questions, e.g.:

  * Top-performing categories/products
  * Monthly/quarterly trends
  * Customer segmentation and revenue analysis

### 5. **Power BI Dashboard**

* Connected Power BI to the MySQL database.
* Created interactive visuals: KPIs, bar charts, trend lines, maps, and filters.
* Designed a professional dashboard highlighting main insights.

### 6. **Reporting & Presentation**

* Compiled results and visuals into a structured report.
* Created a concise presentation using **Gamma** to communicate insights effectively.

## 📈 Dashboard Overview

**Power BI Dashboard Includes:**

* Key metrics (Revenue, Profit, Orders, Customers)
* Time-based trends and category-wise performance
* Regional insights and customer segmentation
* Interactive slicers for flexible analysis

*(Include a screenshot of the dashboard if available)*

---

## 💡 Results & Insights

* [Add 3–5 key insights derived from the analysis, e.g.:]

  * “Customer retention rate increased by 15% in Q3.”
  * “Category X contributes 45% of total revenue.”
  * “Sales peak during holiday seasons across all regions.”
